# Monte Carlo Simulation of Freely-Jointed Polymer Chains

This project simulates the statistical behavior of polymer chains using the **Freely-Jointed Chain (FJC) model**. The goal is to compute key physical quantities (such as end-to-end distance, radius of gyration, and structure factor) and validate them against theoretical predictions using **Monte Carlo methods**.

## Features

- Simulates 3D configurations of polymer chains using the FJC model.
- Calculates mean square end-to-end distance ⟨Q²⟩ and radius of gyration ⟨Rg²⟩.
- Compares simulation results with theoretical values (e.g., Gaussian chain distribution, Guinier approximation).
- Implements **Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm** to study force-extension behavior under external pulling force.
- Includes visualization of polymer conformations and force-extension curves.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
